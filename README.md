You may have heard about the legendary infamous "You are an idiot" virus. This virus infected thousands of computers by just they opening its website. This is the script which is nearly 
realistic to the real one. But this script doesn't causes any harm to your computer or anywhere you are using it. Just download and click on the ".py" file to start it. Make sure to not delete any file (.mp3 or .png) because they are useful to make this script work. Just click on ".py" file to start it. This virus is totaly fake and harmless. It just uses tkinter to summon popups and you can close them by these easy options:
1. Close via Restart: The most working option of all time. This is the most powerful option for closing this. No explanation for how to use this. You can just go to start menu and click it.
2. CLose via Alt+F4: If you have less popups on your screen, this method will work definitely on your PC. Just keep holding Alt+F4 until all popups close. But if you have this file opened
from a long time, this option might be longer than expected. If you can't do with Alt+F4, use the first or third option to close it.
3. Close via closing terminal: Look for the Command Prompt or Terminal window in the taskbar, then right click it, and then click "Close window". This option has high chance to work. Because
the terminal is the root of this script. And if you break the root, the whole plant's leaves(Popups) will be broken too.

Make sure to use this for prank purposes only, using this for wrong things can be dangerous. Be mindful about where and how you use this.
